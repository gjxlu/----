DIARY2___________________________________________________
Be together, alive or not, for there rests your dream so quiet
Dream of continuing a life
The sky's lost its beauty, but still you wait to stand up after try and try
Wherever you are, I'll spare no expense to find you
Miracles are made by veins of mankind
And right engraved in my blood is your cry
Be together, alive or not, and I'm awaiting news about you as seconds tick by
Believe in your strong life
You're out of my sight, but never out of my mind
Wherever you are, I'll spare no expense to find you
Miracles are made by veins of mankind
For we join hands and make roads to your homesite
Be together, alive or not, for that makes silence heard worldwide
Feel the pain but never cry
Love is your legend and after the storm rainbows will rise
Wherever you are, I'll spare no expense to find you
Miracles are made by veins of mankind
And your faint hope is all my drive
